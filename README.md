# data_gui
A simple GUI for a swift look at a pandas dataframe. 
To goal is to support many file formats, currently only supporting `.root` files.

Work in progress. 



## Running the program


After installation, just run the command `datagui`. 


## Installation


You can install via pip: 

```
pip install  git+git://github.com/KonstantinSchubert/data_gui.git
```

However, you will need to have `PyQt4` installed which can not be installed via `pip`.
If you need to install it, your easiest bet is your system's package manager...

Worse even, since this software is only supporting ROOT files at the moment, 
you need [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) installed...
